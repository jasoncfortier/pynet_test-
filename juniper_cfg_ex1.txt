Using Juniper's Conf format in an external file, configure the ge-0/0/2 interface on the vMX1
router to be 10.100.1.1/24.

Note, you will need to use `merge=False`. To ensure you replace any existing IP address.

cfg.load(path="configure_ip.conf", format="text", merge=False)

This will also require that you use the 'replace:' keyword in your configuration stanza

interfaces {
    ge-0/0/2 {
        unit 0 {
            replace:
            family inet {
                address 10.100.1.1/24;
            }
        }
    }
}

Be sure that you perform a diff() operation and verify your change prior to performing a commit().
