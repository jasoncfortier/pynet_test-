Use the custom RPC method discovered in the previous exercise (get_lldp_neighbors_information)

Using this method retrieve the LLDP neighbor XML data from one of the vMX routers and use
xmltodict() to convert this XML data to a Python dictionary.


You probably need code similar to the following.

    import xmltodict
    my_dict = xmltodict.parse(etree.tostring(xml_out, encoding='unicode'))

Where 'xml_out' is the XML object retrieved from the get_lldp_neighbors_information call.


From the data retrieved back print out the the local_port, remote_port, and remote_system.
